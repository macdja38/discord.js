Installing discord.js
=====================

To install discord.js, you need a few dependencies.

.. warning:: **When installing with any of these methods, you'll encounter some errors.** This is because an optional dependency isn't working properly, but discord.js should still work fine.

-----------

Windows
-------

------------

- You need `Visual Studio`_ and `Python 2.7`_.

Your Visual Studio installation ideally has to be recent, but you can try installing without it first. You can use **Express, Community, Enteprise** or any others apart from ``VS Code``.

- You (obviously) need `NodeJS`_. Node 4 or higher is recommended.

After you have installed these things, to install just run: ``npm install --save --msvs_version=2015 discord.js`` to install the latest version of discord.js for your project.

- Install `ffmpeg`_ and add it to your PATH.
