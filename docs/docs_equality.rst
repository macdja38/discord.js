Equality
========

The Equality class is used to see if two objects are equal, based on ``object_1.id === object_2.id``.

If any class in Discord extends equality, it means you should never the default equality operands (``==`` & ``===``) as they could potentially be different instances and therefore appear not to be equal. Instead, use ``equalityObject.equals()`` as shown below.

.. code-block:: js

	object1.equals(object2); // GOOD ✓

	object1 == object2; // BAD ✖
