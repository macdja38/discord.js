Welcome to discord.js's documentation!
======================================

===========================
**Other Version Notice**
===========================

The docs hosted here are for the discord.js v8.2 branch otherwise known as discordv8. There is a different discord.js v11 branch and if you are on a discord server for discord.js that is probably the one you are using.

.. danger:: This documentation is for the discord.js 8.2 branch called discordv8 maintained by macdja38. You're **probably** looking for documentation on version 9 or higher, which is available on `the up-to-date, official docs site`_

discordv8 is an easy-to-use and intuitive JavaScript API for Discord_. It's fairly high level, so if you're
looking for something low level, check out `discord.io`_. If you are looking for something fast check out `eris`_

if you're having problems, check out the `troubleshooting guide`_

Feel free to make any contributions you want, whether it be through creating an issue, giving a suggestion or making a pull request!

.. note:: This documentation is still a work-in-progress, apologies if something isn't yet documented!
